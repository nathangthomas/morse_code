# Morse Code
This is my first Arduino project made with the intention to explore C++ and was inspired by my grandfather Gordon Thomas who worked for the rail road from 1945 - 1979 on the Cotton Belt Route.

## Getting started
If you do not already have the Arduino IDE download and install it from here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
Next, youâ€™ll need to `fork` the repo as your own. Once you have done that, copy and paste the code into your Arduino IDE.
Navigate to the Serial Monitor (the magnifying glass icon on the top right hand corner of the page).
Input your desired message and press `Send`.

## Functionality
Once powered up there is a single blinking green light that indicates it is ready to receive a message. Once the desired message is entered and sent the green light stops blinking and a white light begins sending the morse code message via a blinking light signal.
